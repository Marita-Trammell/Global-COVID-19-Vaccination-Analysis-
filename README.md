# Global COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis and visualization of global COVID-19 vaccination data using Tableau. The project aims to provide insights into vaccination trends, coverage, and the impact of vaccination efforts worldwide.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Directory containing the raw and processed data files.
  - **Full_Vaccination_Data.csv**: Dataset containing global COVID-19 vaccination data.
- **dashboard/**: Directory containing the Tableau workbook.
  - **Global Vaccine Tracker (COVID-19).twbx**: Tableau workbook with the dashboard.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
- Tableau

## Usage
- Open the Tableau workbook (global_covid19_vaccination_dashboard.twbx) in Tableau to explore the dashboard.

## Data Set 
-Full_Vaccination_Data.csv: Contains data on COVID-19 vaccination coverage, doses administered, and other relevant metrics for countries worldwide.
## Data Cleaning 
-Removed irrelevant columns and rows with missing data.

-Converted date columns to appropriate formats.

-Created new features for analysis, such as vaccination rate per capita.
## Data Exploration 
-Provided statistical summaries for key metrics.

-Explored relationships between vaccination rates, COVID-19 cases, and demographic factors.
## Data Visualization
-Developed a Tableau dashboard with interactive visualizations, including:

-Global map showing vaccination coverage by country.

-Time series charts displaying the progression of vaccination efforts over time.

-Bar charts comparing vaccination rates across different regions and countries.

-Identified trends and patterns in global vaccination efforts.

-Highlighted countries with high and low vaccination coverage.

-Analyzed the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 case numbers.
## Conclusions and Recoomednations 
Based on the analysis and visualizations, the following conclusions and recommendations are proposed:

-Increase Vaccination Efforts in Low-Coverage Areas:

Focus on regions with low vaccination rates to improve global immunity.

-Monitor and Address Vaccine Hesitancy:

Identify areas with high vaccine hesitancy and implement targeted campaigns to address concerns.

-Continue Data Collection and Analysis:

Maintain up-to-date data collection and analysis to monitor the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and adjust strategies accordingly.
